<h2 style="text-align:center">Pink floyd - The Wall</h2>
<h5>Description.</h5>
<p>"The wall" is a rock album that was given to us by Pink Floyd in 1979.
The album was written by mostly the legend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters">Roger Waters</a>.<br>
In 1982 a movie was released (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084503/">pink floyd: The Wall</a>),
the movie could clearly picture the concept behind the album with the help of Pink(the protagonist of the movie).<br>

  [Intro]<br>
...we came in?<br>
<br>
[Verse: Roger Waters]<br>
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show <br>
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow <br>
Tell me, is something eluding you, sunshine? <br>
Is this not what you expected to see? <br>
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes <br>
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise <br>
<br>
[Bridge: Roger Waters] <br>
Lights! <br>
Roll the sound effects! <br>
Action! <br>
Drop it, drop it on 'em <br>
Drop it, drop it on them! <br>

<br>
[Verse 1: David Gilmour]<br>
Momma loves her baby <br>
And Daddy loves you too <br>
And the sea may look warm to you, babe <br>
And the sky may look blue <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby blue <br>
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe <br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]<br>
If you should go skating <br>
On the thin ice of modern life <br>
Dragging behind you, the silent reproach <br>
Of a million tear stained eyes <br>
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice <br>
Appears under your feet <br>
You'll slip out of your depth and out of your mind <br>
With your fear flowing out behind you <br>
As you claw the thin ice <br>

  Leaving just a memory <br>
  A snapshot in the family album <br>
  Daddy, what else did you leave for me? <br>
  Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me? <br>
  All in all, it was just a brick in the wall <br>
  All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall <br>

[Intro: Roger Waters]<br>
You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddie!<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]<br>
When we grew up and went to school <br>
There were certain teachers who <br>
Would hurt the children in any way they could (Oof!) <br>
By pouring their derision upon anything we did <br>
Exposing every weakness <br>
However, carefully hidden by the kid <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2: Roger Waters] <br>
But in the town, it was well known, when they got home at night <br>
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives <br>

She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing <br>

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry <br>
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you <br>

“Hello?” <br>

“Are you feeling okay?” <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]<br>
Day after day, the love turns gray <br>
Like the skin of the dying man <br>
And night after night, we pretend it's all right <br>
But I have grown older, and you have grown colder <br>
And nothing is very much fun any more <br>
And I can feel one of my turns coming on <br>
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet <br>
Dry as a funeral drum <br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Roger Waters] <br>
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left <br>
You'll find my favourite axe <br>
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase <br>
One of my bad days <br>
Would you like to watch TV? Or get between the sheets? <br>
Or contemplate the silent freeway? <br>
Would you like something to eat? Would you like to learn to fly? <br>
Would ya? Would you like to see me try? <br>
Ah, no!<br>

Would you like to call the cops?<br>
Do you think it's time I stopped?<br>
Why are you running away?<br>

Pink Floyd! Pink Floyd! <br>
Pink Floyd! Pink Floyd! <br>
Pink Floyd! Pink Floyd! <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters] <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Roger Waters] <br>
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise <br>
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes <br>
With your empty smile and your hungry heart <br>
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past <br>
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters <br>
And the hammers batter down your door <br>
You better run! <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters] <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
Run, run, run, run <br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Roger Waters] <br>
You better run all day and run all night <br>
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside <br>
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight <br>
You better park the car well out of sight <br>
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks <br>
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box <br>
You better run!<br>

<li>Waiting for the Worms</li><br>
[Intro: David Gilmour] <br>
"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!" <br>
Ooh-ooh, you cannot reach me now <br>
Ooh-ooh, no matter how you try <br>
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over <br>
Walk on by <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Roger Waters] <br>
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall <br>
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come) <br>
In perfect isolation here behind my wall <br>
Waiting for the worms to come <br>
 <br>
[Bridge: Roger Waters] <br>
Testing. One. Two. One. Two. The worms will convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going in force! <br>
 <br>
[Hook: Roger Waters] <br>
(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood <br>
(Waiting) To clean up the city <br>
(Waiting) To follow the worms <br>
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt <br>
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings <br>
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors <br>
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain <br>
(Waiting) To follow the worms <br>
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens <br>
(Waiting) For the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews <br>
(Waiting) To follow the worms <br>
[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Roger Waters] <br>
Would you like to see Britannia rule again <br>
(Would you like to see us rule again) <br>
My friend? <br>
All you have to do is follow the worms <br>
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again <br>
(Would you like to send them home again) <br>
My friend? <br>
All you need to do is follow the worms <br>
<br>
[Outro, Roger Waters]<br>
The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station, where we'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road <br>
<br>
At that point, we'll be heading towards Lambeth Road, where we will walk calmly with resistance, leaving twelve minutes to three as we move along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge <br>
<br>
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge, we're in Westminister Borough area. It's quite possible that we may encounter some Jew boys all the way from 4, 5, and 6 on the way as we go <br>
<br>
Now is the time to clean up the city, for this is the beginning! We need to secure our people! We can't stand around and let ourselves be robbed, maimed, and killed!<br>
<br>
And when we make it to the Highclock Corner, I want you to spread out and find them!<br>
<br>
Storm the halls, and then tear the walls and the doors! Break down the doors and hunt them where they are!<br>
<br>
(Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!)<br>
<br>
Stop!<br>

<li>Stop</li><br>
[Verse: Roger Waters] <br>
I wanna go home <br>
Take off this uniform and leave the show <br>
But I'm waiting in this cell, because I have to know <br>
(Have to know, have to know...) <br>
Have I been guilty all this time? <br>
(Have to know, have to know, have to know, have to know...) <br>
(Time, time, time, time...)<br>

<li>The Trial</li><br>
[Intro] <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1: Prosecutor] <br>
Good morning, Worm your honour <br>
The crown will plainly show the prisoner <br>
Who now stands before you <br>
Was caught red-handed, showing feelings <br>
Showing feelings of an almost human nature <br>
This will not do <br>
Call the schoolmaster! <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2: The Schoolmaster] <br>
I always said he'd come to no good in the end, your honour <br>
If they'd let me have my way, I could have flayed him into shape <br>
But my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists <br>
Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Pink (and Choir)] <br>
Crazy, toys in the attic, I am crazy <br>
Truly gone fishing <br>
They must have taken my marbles away! <br>
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy) <br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Wife] <br>
You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key <br>
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no! <br>
You had to go your own way <br>
Have you broken any homes up lately? <br>
Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone <br>
[Verse 4: Mother] <br>
Babe! <br>
Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms <br>
M'lud I never wanted him to get in any trouble <br>
Why'd he ever have to leave me?<br>
Worm, your honour, let me take him home <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Pink (and Choir)] <br>
Crazy, over the rainbow, I am crazy <br>
Bars in the window <br>
There must have been a door there in the wall <br>
When I came in <br>
(Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy) <br>
 <br>
[Verse 5: The Judge] <br>
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible <br>
There's no need for the jury to retire <br>
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before <br>
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law <br>
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother <br>
Fills me with the urge to defecate <br>
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)<br>
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear <br>
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers <br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
[Outro: Crowd]<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>
Tear down the wall! <br>

*bricks crumbling*<br>

<li>Outside the Wall</li><br>
[Verse] <br>
All alone, or in twos <br>
The ones who really love you <br>
Walk up and down, outside the wall <br>
Some hand in hand <br>
And some gathered together in bands <br>
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand <br>
And when they've given you their all <br>
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy <br>
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall <br>
 <br>
[Outro] <br>
Isn't this where... <br>
